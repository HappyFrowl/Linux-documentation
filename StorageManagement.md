## File System management

* **inode** - index node 
    - it is an object storing meta deta about a file or directory on a given file system
    - It contains:
      - Last time of change, access, modification.
      - Owner/permission data.
      - block-level location data, aka physical disk location of the object data.
    - Directory is a list of names assigned to inodes:
      - Contains entries for itself, its parents, and its children.
    - A disk can run out of inodes before running out of disk space, which prevents new file creation.
    - Inodes can be used to delete strangely named files that wonâ€™t tab-complete.

    - `ls -i` - See the inode number.
    - `find . -inum <inode number>`: Find file by inode number.
    - `df -ih` - see inode usage on a partition level

### The storage structure is governed by **three** main layers:
* **Partition table** (GPT/MBT)
    * AKA disklabel or label
    * This defines how a disk is partitioned
    * it is the same for the whole disk 
    * Examples: MBR (old, limited to 2TB) and GPT (modern, supports larger disks and more partitions).
    * Created using `parted mklabel`. See below

* **Partition**
    * Section of the storage drive that logically acts as a separate drive 
    * **Partition types**
        * Primary   - contain one file system or logical drive. Sometimes called a Volume. 
            * Boot partition and swap space are normally created in the primary partition
        * Extended  - contains several file systems which are referrred to as logical drives
        * Logical   - partitioned and allocated as an independent unit and functions as a seperate drive

* **File system**
    * A data structure used by an OS to store, retrieve, organize,  and manage files and riectories on storage devices 
    * examples
        * FAT
            * older
            * compatible with most other OS
        * ext2/3/4
            * Native Linux
        * XFS
            * high-performance journalisting file system
            * fast recovery
            * handles large files very well
        * BTRFS
            * supports huge volumes, 16 exabytes

    * **VFS** - virtual file system
        * This is common software interface that sits between the kernel and the real file system
        * It translates the real file system's details over to the kernel
        * It looks like a real file system
        * **Functionality**
            * It enables having multiple different file systems on the same Linux installation
            * They will all look uniform to the system and the user
        * They will be recognizible by their file system labels
            * These can be up to 16 characters long
            * `e2label` - see or change ext-based file systems
            * `xfs_admin` - same but for XFS-based file systems 

### Managing partitions and file systems 
* `fdisk </dev/>`
    * Manage partition tables and partitions on a hard disk
    * bit of an old tool
    * **options:**
        * `-l` - list partitions 
        * `-b` - Specify number of drive sectors
        * `-H` - specify number of drive heads
        * `-S` - specify number of sectors per tracks
        * `-s` - print partition size in blocks
    * within the fdisk tool, there are several options:
        * `g` - create gpt disk label type
        * `p` - print disk partition info
        * `n` - create a new partition table
        * `w` - write the changes
        * `q` - cancel and quit

* `parted`
    * Newer standard for table and partition management of disks 
    * benefits over `fdisk`
        * in contrast to `fdisk`, `parted` allows for resizing of partitions
        * works better for GPT
        * works with large disks
        * allows scripting
    * `mklabel gpt /dev/sd#` - create a new disk / partition table
    * `mkpart <name> <FS-type> <start> <end>` - create a partition
        * <start> and <end> can be in (kilo/mega/giga/tera)bytes or percentages
        * Note: specifiying the filesystem is purely administrative. It can be left out or mismatch the specification at the mkfs.# level. See below
    * `resizepart <part number> <new size>` - resize a partition

* `wipefs` - wipe file system
    * wipe the file system using the `--all </dev/>` option
    * it does not wipe the files themselves

* `mkfs.<type> /dev/sd#` - make file system
    - Build a filesystem on a hard disk partition
        - e.g. `mkfs.ext2/3/4` & `mkfs.xfs` and `mkfs.btrfs`
    - Some options:
        - `-v` - verbose
        - `-c` - check for bad blocks before building the file system

* `partprobe` 
    * inform the OS of partition table changes
    * This updates the kernels with changes that now exist within the partition table
    * It eliminates the necessity to reboot the system


* `/etc/fstab` - file system table
    - Dictates how mounting happens at startup.
    - Describes what devices are mounted, where, and with which options.
    - **components**
        * File system
            * name or UUID of the partition
            * UUID can be found using `blkid`
        * mount points
            * location on the file system where it needs to be mounted
        * type
            * type of file system used by the partition
        * options 
            * set of comma-separated options that will be activated when the file system is mounted
        - **dump**: If enabled, the dump command makes a backup.
        - **pass**: Used by `fsck` to determine the order of file system checks at boot:
            - `0`: No check.
            - `1`: Root disk.
            - `2`: After root disk

* `/etc/crypttab` 
    * file storing information about encrypted devices and partitions that must be unlocked and mounted on system boot

* `lsblk` - list block
    - Lists information about storage devices, such as
        - device and partition name
        - `MAJ:MIN` - Major Number (Maj): Identifies the device type (e.g., 8 is for SCSI/SATA disks) and Minor Number (Min): Differentiates individual devices or partitions under the same major number.
        - size of the device or partition
        - `RO` - Read-Only value. `0` for read-write and `1` for read-only
        - mount points
    - partially same info as `fdisk -l`
    - options:
        - `-a` - list empty devices
        - `-r` - use raw output format
        - `-f` - output info about filesystems, e.g. UUID 
        - `-l` - output list instead of tree
        - `-m` - display device permission info
    
* `blkid` - block id
    * print the UUID of devices 
    * this is used to add the devices to `/etc/fstab` 

* `mount [options] <dev> <mountpoint>`  
    * mount a file system
    * `-t` - specify target
    * `--mkdir` - create directory if not exists
    * `-a` - mount all file systems defined in `/etc/fstab`
    * options are normally added in the `/etc/fstab` file
        * auto      - device must be mounted automatically
        * noauto    - device should not be mounted automatically
        * nouser    - Only root user can mount a device or file system
        * user      - all users can mount 
        * exec      - allow binaries in a file system to be executed
        * noexec    - do not allow binaries in a file system to be executed
        * ro        - mount file system as read only
        * rw        - mount file system with read/write permissions
        * sync      - input and output operations should be done synchronously
        * async     - input and output operations can be done asynchronously

* `umount <mount point>` - unmount
    * unmount a file system
    * options
        * `-f` - force
        * `-l` - perform a lazy unmount. File system is detached from a hierarchy, but refereneces to that file system are not cleaned up until the file system is not being used
        * `-R` - recursively unmounts the directories mount points
        * `-t <fs type>` - unmount all file system types specified
        * `-O` - unmount only the file systems with specified options in the `/etc/fstab` file
        * `-fake` - dryrun it

* **So in order to take a used disk and repurpose it:**
    * wipe disk using `dd` (see below). If wiping the file system without deleting the files `wipefs` works as well 
    * create a new drive label with `parted mklabel` and a new partition using `parted mkpart`
    * format the partition `mkfs.<type>`
    * add formatted partition to `/etc/fstab` so it can configured by the system to run at boot up
    * run `partprobe` if needing to use the drive immediately without rebooting
    * mount it using `mount`

* `/etc/mtab` 
    * reports the status of currently mounted file systems

* `/proc/mounts`
    * Same but more accurate and includes more up-to-date info on file systems

* `/proc/partitions`
    * contains info about each partition attached to the system
    * contains 
        * major     - class of device
        * minor     - divides partitions into physical devices
        * blocks    - number of physical blocks the partition takes up

## The Linux File System

`/` - Root
- The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy.

`/bin` - Essential Binaries
- Contains binaries or executables that are essential to the entire OS.
- Commands like `gzip`, `curl`, `ls` are stored here.
- All users can by default run these 

`/sbin` - System Binaries
- Contains system binaries or executables for the superuser (root).
- Example: `mount`.

`/lib` - Libraries
- Shared libraries for essential binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin` are stored here.

`/usr` - User Directory
- Contains non-essential binaries or executables intended for the end user.
- Includes:
  - `/usr/bin`: Non-essential binaries.
  - `/usr/sbin`: Non-essential system binaries.
  - `/usr/lib`: Libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.
- `/usr/local`:
  - Contains manually compiled binaries in `/usr/local/bin`.
  - Provides a safe place to avoid conflicts with system-installed packages.
- Path and Precedence
  - All these binaries are mapped together using the `PATH` environment variable (`$PATH`).
  - `which` command shows the location of a binary and gives precedence to `/usr/bin` if the command exists in multiple places.

`/etc` - Editable Text Config
- Stores system configuration files (e.g., `.config` files).

`/home` - User Files
- Contains user-specific files and configurations.

`/boot` - Boot Files
- Contains files required to boot the system:
  - `initrd`
  - The Linux kernel:
    - `vmlinux`: Uncompressed kernel.
    - `vmlinuz`: Compressed kernel.

`/dev` - Device Files
- Provides access to hardware and drivers as if they are files.

`/opt` - Optional Software
- Stores optional or add-on software.

`/var` - Variable Files
- Contains files that change while the OS is running:
  - Logs are stored here.

- `/tmp` - Temporary Files
- Stores temporary files.
- Files in `/tmp` are non-persistent between reboots.

`/proc` - Process Filesystem
- An illusionary filesystem created in memory by the Linux kernel.
- Used to keep track of running processes.


## Hard and Symbolic Links
- **Hard Link**
    - A link to another fileâ€™s inode.
    - Can only occur within the same file system.
    - `ls -la`: Displays hard link count (second column).
    - Directories have a minimum of 2 links: one for itself and one for its parent.
    - Files have a minimum of 1 link.
    - Create hard links with `ln <sourcefile> <destfile>`.
    - Check links with `ls -li`.
    - **Note**: Hard links are not allowed for directories.

  
- **Symbolic (Soft) Link**
    - A link to another file name.
    - Can span across different file systems.
    - Akin to shortcuts in Windows.
    - Useful for linking files between file systems.
    - Create soft links with `ln -s <sourcefile> <destfile>`.

## File localization

* `type`
    - Determines if a command is a shell built-in, alias, or external command.

* `whereis`
    - Outputs the location of a command and its man pages.

* `locate`
    - Locate a file quickly (requires `updatedb`)
    - options:
        - `-r` - use regex
        - `-c` - display or count the bnumber of matching entries found
        - `-e` - return only files that exist at the time of search
        - `-I` - ignmore the casing in file names or paths

* `updatedb`
    - Must be run regularly in order to effectively use `locate`

* `/etc/updatedb.conf`
    - Configuration for `updatedb`, which defines locations not to search.
    - or add them to the $PRUNEPATH variable

- `find` 
    * combine the results with:
        * `-print`      - display the location of the files
        * `-exec`       - execute the comamnd that follows 
        * `-ok`         - execute the command that follow interactively
        * `-delete`     - delete the files found
        * `-fprint`     - tore the results in a target file 

* `which`
    * locate the location of an executable

* `whereis` 
    * Locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.
    * gives more info than `which`

- `stat`
    - Display file or file system status 
    - Output includes details like: 
    -   File name 
    -   File size

## Storage Troubleshooting

* `ulimit` - user limit 
    * limits teh system resources for a user in a Linux-based server
    * `ulimit -n 512`   - limit for max open files is put for a particular user
    * `ulimit -a`       - see all limits configured

- **`df`**: - display filesystem
    * Print filesystem usage.
    * `-h` - human-readable format (e.g., MiBs, GiBs).
    * `-i` - show inodes 

* `du` - disk usage 
    * `-h` - human readable 
    * `-s` - show only total 

* **`quotas`** 
    * Package for managing user quotas
    * `quotacheck`: Scan a file system for disk usage and create/repair quota files.
    * `edquota`: Edit the disk quota for a user.
        - Specifies disk usage, inode usage, and the specific file system to which it applies.
    * `quotaon`: Enable quotas and apply the configuration set in `edquota`.
    * To implement quotas:
        * modify `/etc/fstab` file
        * add `,usrquota` after `defaults`
